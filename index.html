<p>Rebase should never be used on a remote repository, only local</p>

<p>also if we rebase upon a main branch too far ahead, it can cause several errors that have to be fixed mannually</p>
=======

<p>With rebase we can merge 2 branches and all changes made within them and then remove one of the branches and the history will not change</p>

<p>It will seem like nothing happen, like there is no new branch but all the changes happened wihin the same branch</p>
